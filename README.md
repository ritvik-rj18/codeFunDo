##Idea
Idea is to create a platform based on the professions of people. Different people will sign up in the prepared app and due details would be asked from them.Details would mainly focus on their PROFESSIONAl backgorund and and details.Various users then would be able to find a person of their need .
The system would then be like if any user wants to have certain kind work done then he/she can just post the details of the work and the type of professionals he wants ot hire . Then their would be a chatting platform between them so that they can negotiate.
Searching for a kind of professional can then be added with some user friendly features like area they want to make the search in etc.
