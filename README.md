##Idea
The idea is to develop a location based "ALARM" for public.
The app would take data from weather reports and figure out the areas in danger of disaster.Based on the type of disaster certian SAFE nearby areas would be marked in the map and every person in danger area would be given an alert about disaster.
Not only this ,the user would be informed about the nearby places which are safe ,details of rescue officers.
If user finds it impossible to get out of the area then he can gererate a "save" call by clicking just a button .
which will take the help of GPS TO LOACATE ITS POSITION.
HENCE A LARGE PUBLIC CAN BE MIGRATED TO SAFE PLACE BEFORE DISASTER AND MANY CAN BE RESCUED.
